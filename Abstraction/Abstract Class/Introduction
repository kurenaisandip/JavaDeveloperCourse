Abstract Class vs Interface

Similarity:
Abstract classses are similar to interafces. You cannot instantiate them and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.

Difference:
- Abstract Class:
We can declare fields, that are not static and final, and defined public, protected and private concrete methods.

- Interface:
All fields are automatically public, static & final & all methods that we declare or define ( as default methods ) are public.
