Inhertance

In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the 
"inhertance concept" into two categories:
    subclass(child): the class that inherits from another class
    superclass(parent): the class being inherited from 

To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.


Why and when to use the inheritance?

- It is useful for code reusability:reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when we create a new class.
